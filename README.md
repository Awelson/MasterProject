### To-Do

- Make improvements to Powerpoint :
    - Motivation : Detection of +1 allele in samples, more frequent in MMRp tnan MMRd
    - Question : How did the +1 allele arise?
    - Hypothesis : 
        - +1 Allele is a PCR artefact
        - +1 Allele is caused by MMRd
            - unlikely due to previous results
        - +1 Allele is caused by MMR
            - aligns with previous result
            - MMR is known to be involved in trinucleotide expansion diseases
    - Significance :
        - Assuming Hyp 3 is true, +1 Allele frequency can be used as a marker to evaluate MMR function, esp in constitutional sample
        - Assuming Hyp 1 is true, +1 Allele frequency can be used to predict PCR error rate, and this can be used as an extra normalization factor
    - Figure captions
        - Plot 1
            - The assumption is that different markers have different sensitivies to MMR effects
            - We also assume that there is a relationship between the +1 allele and 0 allele freqeuncy
                - since we assume that the +1 allele is generated from insertion mutations occuring in the 0 allele 
        - Plot 2
            - Are markers that are more prone to deletions (via MMRd) also more prone to insertions (via MMR)?
            - We know that microsatellite length positively correlates with mutation rate, specifically deletions
                - Weak correlation suggests that length is not a strong predictor of insertion rate in MMRp samples
                - Suggests independent mechanisms (between insertion in MMRp and deletions in MMRd)

- New plot :
    - Dot plot
        - x-axis : microsatellite length
        - y-axis : Allele frequency (-1 and +1 on different plots)
        - also separate MMRp and MMRd samples

- Start work on CMMRD/blood data
